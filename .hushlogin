     The llooggiinn utility logs users (and pseudo-users) into the computer system.

     If no user is specified, or if a user is specified and authentication of
     the user fails, llooggiinn prompts for a user name.  Authentication of users
     is configurable via pam(8).  Password authentication is the default.

     The following options are available:

     --ff      When a user name is specified, this option indicates that proper
             authentication has already been done and that no password need be
             requested.  This option may only be used by the super-user or
             when an already logged in user is logging in as themselves.

             With the --ff option, an alternate program (and any arguments) may
             be run instead of the user's default shell.  The program and
             arguments follows the user name.

     --hh      Specify the host from which the connection was received.  It is
             used by various daemons such as telnetd(8).  This option may only
             be used by the super-user.

     --ll      Tells the program executed by llooggiinn that this is not a login ses-
             sion (by convention, a login session is signalled to the program
             with a hyphen as the first character of _a_r_g_v_[_0_]; this option dis-
             ables that), and prevents it from chdir(2)ing to the user's home
             directory.  The default is to add the hyphen (this is a login
             session).

     --pp      By default, llooggiinn discards any previous environment.  The --pp
             option disables this behavior.

     --qq      This forces quiet logins, as if a _._h_u_s_h_l_o_g_i_n is present.

     If the file _/_e_t_c_/_n_o_l_o_g_i_n exists, llooggiinn dislays its contents to the user
     and exits.  This is used by shutdown(8) to prevent users from logging in
     when the system is about to go down.

     Immediately after logging a user in, llooggiinn displays the system copyright
     notice, the date and time the user last logged in, the message of the day
     as well as other information.  If the file _._h_u_s_h_l_o_g_i_n exists in the
     user's home directory, all of these messages are suppressed.  --qq is spec-
     ified, all of these messages are suppressed.  This is to simplify logins
     for non-human users, such as uucp(1).  llooggiinn then records an entry in
     utmpx(5) and the like, and executes the user's command interpreter (or
     the program specified on the command line if --ff is specified).

     The llooggiinn utility enters information into the environment (see
     environ(7)) specifying the user's home directory (HOME), command inter-
     preter (SHELL), search path (PATH), terminal type (TERM) and user name
     (both LOGNAME and USER).

     Some shells may provide a builtin llooggiinn command which is similar or iden-
     tical to this utility.  Consult the builtin(1) manual page.

     The llooggiinn utility will submit an audit record when login succeeds or
     fails.  Failure to determine the current auditing state will result in an
     error exit from llooggiinn.
